# Basic React Todo App
---

This is a basic todo app to help my refresh my React skills and prep for an upcoming internship. I want to make sure I fully understand fundamentals before I get too deep into Hooks and whatnot, so I'm using this as my sandbox. Also, I make a todo list everyday, so hopefully I can make it my favorite todo app.

### Future Plans

I also want to make a native version of this app. My job will require mobile development in React Native, so I need to make sure I am comfy with React Native in the next 30 days. 

I want to integrate Firebase into the app so I can use it cross-platform. This might be too much of a challenge, but I don't presume so.
